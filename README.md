Overview â€“ React app that fetches and displays the to-do items from the API. Makes POST, PUT, and DELETE calls to the API to add, update and delete an item from the react state.

--> When the 'npm start' command is executed the browser page will open where all the to-do tasks are listed.

--> To add a new task, type the new task in the input bar and click on the 'ADD' button.

--> To update the existing task, click on the 'UPDATE' button. An input bar will be visible to edit the task, make the required changes and again click on the 'UPDATE' button.

--> To delete the existing task just click on the 'DELETE' button.

--> All these operations like add, update, and delete is just dummy call since the project is not connected to any of the databases. But the changes can be seen in Browser->Inspect->Console.

--> The red-colored left border on the task card indicates that the task is incomplete or pending.

--> The green-colored left border on the task card indicates that the task is completed.
